# update_python_code_and_open_web_API_for_Programming_Collective_Intelligence-2017

It has been over ten years since the book "Programming Collective Intelligence (Toby Segaran)" published in 2007. The attached "example codes" written in Python versions 2.x are thus not compatible with the platform of Python versions 3.x. Furthermore, many Open Web APIs used in the book are out-of-date. The project here aims to update both "example codes" and the Open Web APIs in this book for convenience of newcomers.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome!
