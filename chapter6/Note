In the section "Using Akismet", I found that when execute the following code:

>>> import akismettest
>>> msg='Make money fast! Online Casino!'
>>> akismettest.isspam(msg,'spammer@spam.com','127.0.0.1')

I get the following results:

b'valid' 200
False

(Here I set:

pageurl="https://xihangalpha.wordpress.com/"

)
